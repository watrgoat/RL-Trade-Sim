# RLTradeSim

**RLTradeSim** is a reinforcement learning-driven trading simulator built with Python and OpenAI Gym. The project is designed to optimize trade execution and dynamic portfolio strategies by leveraging advanced RL algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). 

⚠️ **This project is a work in progress (WIP)** ⚠️  
Expect frequent updates, structural changes, and new features as development progresses.

## 🚀 Features (Planned and In Progress)

- **Custom RL Environment**: Simulates realistic trading conditions, including slippage, transaction costs, and market impact.
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Starting with DQN and expanding to PPO, DDPG, and SAC.
- **Market Data Integration**: Historical data sourced from Yahoo Finance and other APIs.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Maximum Drawdown
  - Cumulative P&L
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive dashboards using Matplotlib and Streamlit.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for modularity, allowing easy integration of custom models, environments, and strategies.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/RLTradeSim.git
   cd RLTradeSim
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run a sample script** (coming soon).

## 🧪 Usage (Planned)

- Train an RL agent to optimize trade execution using:
  ```bash
  python scripts/train_agent.py
  ```
- Evaluate the trained agent:
  ```bash
  python scripts/evaluate_agent.py
  ```
