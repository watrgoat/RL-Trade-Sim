# RL-Trade-Sim

**RL-Trade-Sim** is a reinforcement learning-driven trading simulator developed in Python, leveraging OpenAI Gym. The primary objective of this project is to optimize trade execution by utilizing advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The simulator is designed to train agents capable of minimizing slippage, reducing transaction costs, and executing trades efficiently under realistic market conditions.

## Features and Capabilities

- **Custom Reinforcement Learning Environment**: Simulates trading scenarios with factors such as slippage, transaction costs, and market impact.
- **Support for Advanced RL Algorithms**: Starting with DQN and expanding to PPO, DDPG, and SAC for improved decision-making.
- **Market Data Integration**: Uses historical data from sources like Yahoo Finance and other APIs to provide realistic training environments.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Execution cost minimization
  - Slippage reduction
  - Cumulative P&L tracking
- **Visualization Tools**: Performance analysis through plots and interactive dashboards.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design enables easy integration of new models, strategies, and data sources.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objective
To develop an RL agent capable of optimizing **trade execution**, focusing on:
- Minimizing slippage (price deviation from expected execution price).
- Reducing transaction costs (broker fees, market impact).
- Adapting dynamically to market conditions.

### Secondary Objectives
- Benchmark RL performance against baseline strategies like Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
- Incorporate realistic market conditions such as volatility, illiquidity, and order book simulation.
- Develop visualization tools for detailed performance insights.

## What the Project Will Deliver

### Core Functionality
1. A simulated trading environment with realistic constraints.
2. Trained RL agents capable of executing trades efficiently.
3. Metrics and analysis tools to evaluate performance.

### Baseline Comparisons
1. Benchmarks using TWAP and VWAP strategies.
2. Quantitative comparison of RL agent improvements over baseline methods.

### Extensibility
1. Easy integration of new market data sources and strategies.
2. Flexibility to adapt the simulator for related financial tasks.

## Usage (Planned)

- **Training an Agent**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/train_agent.py
  ```
- **Evaluating the Agent**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/evaluate_agent.py
  ```

Detailed documentation and usage examples will be added as development progresses.
